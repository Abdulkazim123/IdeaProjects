*****************************Selenium Class 02********************************

WebElement:
everything that appears on the webpage is called a webelement


Locator:
it is the address or the position of the WebElement on the page

8 locators:
1.id
2.Name
3.Tagname
4.classname
5.linktext
6.partiallinktext
7.xpath
8.css

a webelement have an underlying code
this html code starts with a tag
the tag may have different attributes
these attributes are there to help locate those elements
and in some cases define the other criterias


--We must make sure that the locator that we are opting for
is unique enough
what if there are two same attribute with same values
--selenium is going to return us the first one

ID is the safest and most quick locator used

Why do we need so many locators?
--If the locator is not unqiue we can choose the one that is unique
--the devlopers may not provide us with all the locators

When do we get a noElement Exception?
Selnium was unable to find the element that we are looking for
GO CHECK YOUR LOCTAOR / ATTRIBUTE VALUE

<a> is called anchor tag ,it contain link
we can acces this using locator  "linktext or partiallink"
